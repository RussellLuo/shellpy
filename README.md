ShellPy
=======

Unix/Linux commands implemented in Python.

1| Motivation
-------------

How can we simulate **Shell** commands in **Python**? Here are the possible answers (if not perfect).

Reinventing the wheel is just for learning purpose, that's it!

2| Usage
--------

Make all scripts executable:

    chmod +x *.py

Just run it (e.g. `ls.py`):

    ./ls.py

Get help:

    ./ls.py -h
